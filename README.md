Now that you know everything there is to a Packt video, let's get down to recording our very own sample video!

You'll notice that we have 3 files other than the README:


* Script: This document will take you through the narration that needs to be given in the video, along with how and when you need to refer to the code and PPT in support.

* PPT: There are two PPT slides; one will serve as an introduction to the video and the other as the conclusion.

* Code: The code snippets that are to be used are in this folder. The files are numbered as per the order in which they need to appear in the video (Demo, Demo2, and so on).

All you need to do is use the PPT, code, and script to record a screencast with the specified settings. 

Let your editor know once you're done so that you can discuss and implement the feedback, post which we can move on to the next step in the process!
